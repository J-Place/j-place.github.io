<h4>Dryland Exercises</h4>
<h4><em>Lateral Cord Squeeze</em></h4>
<p>The lateral cord squeeze will help you learn how to contract the strong muscles of your back that power your pull. This is less of a strength exercise and more of a learning tool to help you increase your awareness of how to use these muscles.</p>
<p>To perform this exercise, attach a stretch cord or elastic band to an immovable object. The band should be attached at approximately shoulder level or higher. Turn your body so the band is by your side. You should be far enough away from where the cord or band is attached so that you feel a fair amount of tension while in the final position. With straight arms, pull against the cord and bring your hands down to your hips. Hold that position for three to five seconds.</p>
<h4><em>Resistance-Band Shoulder Dislocate</em></h4>
<p>Because of the repetitive nature of swimming and the constant workload your upper body experiences, your chest and shoulder muscles can become tight. This can lead to a loss of range of motion that can reduce your ability to pull effectively, as well as increase your risk of injury. Resistance-band shoulder dislocate will help you strengthen the muscles in the back of your shoulder as well as improve your range of motion.</p>
<p>Simply hold an exercise band or tube with your palms facing down. From that position, raise the band over and behind your head, spreading the band as you go. Go as far as is comfortable, then return to the starting position.</p>
<h4><em>Side-Lying External Rotation</em></h4>
<p>Side-lying external rotation promotes balance in the muscles of your shoulder. Many of the motions in swimming involve rotating your shoulder toward your body, such as during your pull. This exercise works on improving your external rotation strength, to ensure that you have balanced strength in your shoulders.</p>
<p>To perform this exercise, grab a light dumbbell. Lie on your side with your top elbow on your side. Bend your elbow so that your hand points forward. From this position, carefully rotate the dumbbell toward the ceiling, then lower it back down under control.</p>
<h4><em>Dumbbell Front Raise</em></h4>
<p>A great pull starts with an aggressive arm recovery. If you’re not recovering your arms quickly, you’ll have a difficult time executing a great pull. This is particularly true as you get tired. Dumbbell front raise helps build strength in your shoulders so that you can continue to recover your arms effectively.</p>
<p>To perform this exercise, start with two light dumbbells in your hands. Then raise them under control until they are at eye level, pause briefly, and lower them. Don’t arch your back or move your body.</p>
<h4><em>Face Pull</em></h4>
<p>The purpose of the face pull is to help strengthen the muscles of your upper back, which can often be weakened in swimming. It’s not so much about directly improving your swimming but ensuring you stay healthy so you can do the workouts that allow you to improve.</p>
<p>You can use a cable machine or an elastic band for this exercise. To perform face pulls, set the cable or band so that it is slightly higher than eye level and use a triceps rope attachment if using a cable. Use both hands to grab each end. Then pull the rope toward your face.</p>
<h4><em>Alternating-Dumbbell Front Raise</em></h4>
<p>Alternating-dumbbell front raise is like the previous front raise except that you’ll alternate which arm you raise the dumbbell with. Instead of lifting one at a time with a pause before starting to lift the other one, ensure the dumbbells move continuously in an alternating fashion. This will challenge your shoulders and your torso to maintain stability as you move your arms in opposition, just as in backstroke.</p>
<p>To perform this exercise, start with two light dumbbells in your hands. Raise one to eye level, then lower it. As you lower it, begin to raise the other dumbbell so that you’re raising one arm as the other one is being lowered.</p>
<h4><em>Bar Hang</em></h4>
<p>Swimming a lot of yards and swimming with a high intensity can compress your shoulders, ribcage, and spine. Bar hangs can help to counter this effect by using gravity to re-expand everything. Because there’s a resistance component when you hang on the bar, this exercise develops strength throughout the range of motion you’re developing as well.</p>
<p>To perform this exercise, find a pull-up bar. Grasp the bar with an overhand or underhand grip, whichever you prefer, at approximately shoulder-width apart. Squeeze the bar tight and lift your legs off the ground, preferably slightly in front of your body. Hold this position for a predetermined amount of time.</p>
<h4><em>Wide-Grip Pull-Down</em></h4>
<p>The purpose of wide-grip pull-down is to strengthen the muscles of your back that are responsible for great pulling. Because backstroke is swum with your arms out to your side, use a wide grip.</p>
<p>To perform this exercise, use a lat pull-down machine. Assume a tall posture, and without changing your posture, pull the bar down so that your elbows squeeze into your ribcage. Return the weight with control, also without any change in your posture.</p>
<h4>Push-Up</h4>
<p>Push-ups are a tremendous and easily accessible way to improve the strength of your chest and triceps, two muscle groups that play a large role in creating propulsion. Push-ups also help you train torso stability because they’re essentially moving planks.</p>
<p>To do a push-up, assume a plank position with your spine straight. Without losing your straight-line position, lower your body so that your chest touches the ground. If this version is too difficult for you, perform the exercise on an incline that allows you to achieve a full range of motion.</p>
<h4><em>Single-Arm Dumbbell Bench Press</em></h4>
<p>One of the challenges in swimming is to create force with your upper body in unstable positions. By doing a single-arm dumbbell bench press, you’ll be unbalanced as you press. This helps you learn how to maintain spinal stability while creating force.</p>
<p>To perform this exercise, lie on a bench with a single dumbbell in your hand. Press the dumbbell straight up without letting your body move. Lower the dumbbell under control and complete your set before switching to your other arm.</p>
