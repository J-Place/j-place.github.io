<h4><em style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 2.5rem; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);">Set 1</em></h4>
<p>(4 times through)</p>
<p><em>Odd rounds as smooth as possible<br />
</em><em style="font-size: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.4px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);">Even rounds build each 25</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>2 x 25s side pull&mdash;perform 5 seconds of side-wall pull with each arm before each repetition</li>
    <li>2 x 25s one-arm backstroke&mdash;perform 5 seconds of side-wall pull with each arm before each repetition</li>
    <li>2 x 25s backstroke&mdash;perform 5 seconds of side-wall pull with each arm before each repetition</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Purpose and Focus Points</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to help you get a sense of how to pull straight back using your forearm and hand to push against the water. </p>
<p>During the side-wall pull, focus on creating pressure with your whole forearm and feel the muscles of your chest and back work. Then, try to carry those same sensations into each of the drills. Just focus on pulling straight back during the side pull, add the body rotation and recovery during one-arm backstroke, and then put it all together during regular backstroke. Try to add a touch of speed on the even rounds without losing any of the skill.</p>
<h4><em><br />
Set 2</em></h4>
<p>(3 times through)</p>
<p><em>Take about 20 seconds rest after each repetition<br />
</em><em style="font-size: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.4px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);">Take about 40 seconds rest after each round</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>2 x 25s side pull&mdash;perform 5 seconds of side-wall pull with each arm before each repetition</li>
    <li>3 x 50s backstroke with a buoy (swim 25 closed fist, 25 open hand)</li>
    <li>50 backstroke with upside-down paddles&mdash;build</li>
    <li>50 backstroke&mdash;get faster each round</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Purpose and Focus Points</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this set is to work on developing a strong pull, putting more emphasis on swimming than drilling. </p>
<p>Set things up with the side-wall pull and side pull. During the side-wall pull, focus on creating pressure with your whole forearm and feel the muscles of your chest and back working. Then get the same sensation while doing side pull. </p>
<p>When swimming with a buoy, you must create propulsion without your legs. By using closed fist and upside-down paddles, you&rsquo;ll develop a better sense of how to use your forearms to create propulsion. Then put it all together with backstroke, adding a touch of speed.</p>
<h4><em><br />
Set 3</em></h4>
<p>(3 times through)</p>
<p><em>Take about 20 seconds rest after each repetition<br />
</em><em style="font-size: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.4px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);">Take about 60 seconds rest after each round</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>50 side pull&mdash;take as few strokes as possible</li>
    <li>2 x 75s backstroke with buoy&mdash;take fewer strokes on the second 75</li>
    <li>50 single-single-double&mdash;take as few strokes as possible</li>
    <li>2 x 75s backstroke with buoy&mdash;take one less stroke per 25 for both 75s</li>
    <li>50 double-arm backstroke&mdash;take as few strokes as possible</li>
    <li>2 x 75s backstroke with buoy&mdash;take the same number of strokes each 75; No. 2 is faster</li>
    <li>100 backstroke swim&mdash;each round gets faster</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Purpose and Focus Points</strong></p>
<p>In this set, you&rsquo;re going to add stroke counts so that you can start to measure your efficiency. Your goal is to learn how to get more out of each stroke with a great pull. By keeping track of the numbers, and trying to change them in different ways, you can get a sense of what&rsquo;s effective for you. You&rsquo;ll do this during the drills and when using a buoy. Changing your stroke count with a buoy ensures that you can&rsquo;t cheat by using your legs. Then you&rsquo;ll apply your newfound efficiency to some backstroke swimming at the end of each round.</p>
<h4><em><br />
Set 4</em></h4>
<p><em>Take about 15 seconds rest after the 25s<br />
</em><em style="font-size: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.4px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);">Take about 30 seconds rest after the 175/125/75s<br />

<ul>
    <li>4 x 25s closed fist&mdash;odd side pull, even double-arm backstroke</li>
    <li>2 x 175s backstroke with a buoy&mdash;take two less strokes on the even-numbered 25s than on the odd-numbered 25s</li>
    <li>150 backstroke swim with steady effort&mdash;take the same stroke count for each 25</li>
    <li>4 x 25s pinch paddles&mdash;odds side pull, evens double-arm backstroke</li>
    <li>4 x 125s backstroke with a buoy&mdash;descend 1&ndash;4 using the same stroke count</li>
    <li>150 backstroke swim with solid effort&mdash;take the same stroke count each 25</li>
    <li>4 x 25s upside-down paddles&mdash;odds side pull, evens double-arm backstroke</li>
    <li>6 x 75s backstroke with a buoy&mdash;odds take as few strokes as possible, evens as fast as possible</li>
    <li>150 backstroke swim with strong effort&mdash;take the same stroke count each 25</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Purpose and Focus Points</strong></p>
<p>This set has an aerobic component to it, and you&rsquo;ll learn how to control your stroke counts, and thus your pull, over longer stretches. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll start each section with some drills focused on establishing a great pull. You&rsquo;ll make this more effective by using hand postures that promote effective pulling. Then you&rsquo;ll transition into backstroke swimming with a buoy, isolating your pull. You&rsquo;ll have to manage your stroke count and your speed, and the only way to do that is to adjust your pull. Then you&rsquo;ll practice executing these skills where it really matters, during backstroke swimming, again being consistent with your stroke count.</p>
<h4><em><br />
Set 5</em></h4>
<p>(2 times through)</p>
<p><em>Take about 30-45 seconds rest after each repetition<br />
</em><em style="font-size: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.4px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);">Take about 2 minutes rest after round 1</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>4 x 25s double-arm backstroke&mdash;odds as few strokes as possible, evens as fast as possible</li>
    <li>2 x 25s backstroke&mdash;1 build to fast, 2 fast</li>
    <li>4 x 25s backstroke with buoy and upside-down paddles&mdash;odds as few strokes as possible, evens as fast as possible</li>
    <li>2 x 25s backstroke&mdash;1 build to fast, 2 fast</li>
    <li>4 x 25s backstroke with buoy and pinch paddles&mdash;odds as few strokes as possible, evens as fast as possible</li>
    <li>2 x 25s backstroke&mdash;1 build to fast, 2 fast</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Purpose and Focus Points</strong></p>
<p>This set is about learning to execute your skills at speed. </p>
<p>Each section starts off with a specific drill. On the odd repetitions, you&rsquo;ll shoot for maximum efficiency, and for the even repetitions, you&rsquo;ll shoot for maximum speed. The specific drills help you learn how to do this with effective pulling. </p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s about applying those skills while swimming backstroke fast. On the odd repetitions, focus on feeling out your speed. After that, just let it rip and see what happens. The overall focus is on getting a feel for your pull, and then applying that skill where it really matters: swimming backstroke at speed.</p>
