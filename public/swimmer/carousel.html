                    <p>Open water starts and finishes make up a small portion of open water races but occupy a large part of each competitor’s mind and cause anxiety. They can also have a major impact on your place. A poor start can get you caught behind slower swimmers you have to spend energy getting around, and a slow finish can let somebody shoot by you.</p>
                    <p>With preparation, you can ensure that your starts and finishes enhance your races, not hurt them. Developing an effective start and finish strategy, along with practicing the proper technique and developing a tolerance for the chaos of a group start, will help you become more successful during your open water races this season.</p>
                    <h3>Starts</h3>
                    <p>Starts can leave even the seasoned open water competitor feeling discombobulated. Incidental contact with other swimmers while getting into the water can leave you feeling disoriented and fatigued. Expecting some degree of confusion at the start, remaining as relaxed as possible, and settling into your fastest possible sustainable pace once in the water will help set you up for success.</p>
                    <p>Practice swimming short bursts of speed prior to race day, allowing yourself to get uncomfortable, then settling into your top possible open water pace. Your energy systems will be ready to race and so will you.</p>

These starts can be chaotic, both on land and in the water.</p>
                                        <p>If you’re a novice open water swimmer focused on completing a race, or you simply prefer to avoid jostling with other swimmers, line up at the back of the group or to the side. This will give you more room to enter the water and transition into your swimming. If you’re focused on your time, place yourself toward the front of the pack and hit the gas at the sound of the start horn. Most swimmers fall somewhere in between.</p>

Dragging your feet across the surface of the water will slow you down considerably. Instead, you’ll need to run with high knees and recover your feet by swinging them wide to the side to avoid dragging them through the water.</p>

To do this properly and when you reach a safe depth, reach your hands above your head, and dive forward, but propel your hands toward the bottom. Anchor both your hands on the bottom and use them to draw your legs up under your body. Then, use both your hands and feet to drive your body up and forward, out and over the water. Once the water is deep enough for you to swim freely, whether that’s after your first dolphin or later, start swimming. You should start swimming once your fingers are no longer scraping the bottom. Also, be aware that water depths can fluctuate, so you might need to transition between running, dolphining, and swimming. If possible, practice your entry several times at the race venue. Never dolphin if you do not know what’s on the bottom or how deep the water is.</p>
