                                 <p>See that out there? That wide-open expanse of blue loveliness? That’s open water. No walls. No lane lines. And best of all, no black line.</p>
                                 <p>If you’re new to open water swimming, there are some things you should know before you take your first plunge into that inviting blue yonder. This series of articles aims to provide new open water swimmers with the information they need to feel confident joining in this beautiful activity. Open water swimming has grown by leaps and bounds over the past decade and was accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many pools around the country closed and forced swimmers outside, some for the first time.</p>
                                 <p>This all amounts to good news for newbies and prospective open water swimmers looking to take the plunge. New opportunities and swimming pods are emerging constantly for Masters swimmers interested in making the leap from the pool to the wilds of open water.</p>
                                 <p>Open water swimming is an inviting, inclusive activity, in which being competitive isn’t restricted to being the fastest; maybe you can outlast the others or maybe there are no others in your chosen event and it’s just you against yourself.</p>
                                 <p>What’s more, the folks who participate come from all walks of life. They range from speedy former collegiate champions to leisure enthusiasts who just like to enjoy a little nature buzz in the local lake. Open water swimmers come in all sizes and shapes and possess a vast spectrum of abilities and disabilities—and that’s part of what makes it such a fun activity to get involved in.</p>
                                 <p>Dedicated open water swimmers also tend to be a welcoming, if wacky, bunch, eager to share their knowledge and have new swimmers join them at their favorite swimming spots. From lakes and ponds to rivers and oceans, there’s bound to be some water near you that’s open and ready to be explored.</p>
                                 <p>Are you ready to dive in? Great! Let’s go!</p>

                                 <h2>How to Stay Safe in the Open Water</h2>
                                 <p>The first and most important element of open water swimming is understanding how to safely take part in it. On a planet that’s 71% water, there’s no shortage of open bodies of water, but not all are created equal and not all are swimmable.</p>
                                 <p>To determine whether a particular waterway is safe for swimming, it’s generally best to connect with a local group of open water swimmers. Not only can they give you the down-low on the best swimming holes around, but an established group can also offer you plenty of swim buddies. You should never swim alone. Plus, you’ll be able to benefit from the group’s experience in everything from where to swim to when the conditions are best and what local hazards to watch out for.</p>
                                 <p>You can also check with local waterway users, such as anglers and boaters. They often have a good read of the situation and can tell you which areas to steer clear of and what conditions you can expect to encounter on the water.</p>
                                 <p>If you’ve determined that a local waterway is safe, the next step is to make yourself as visible as you can while swimming so that other waterway users can spot you and avoid hitting you. This means wearing a brightly colored swim cap (but not white) and using a tow float.</p>
                                 <h3>Test H3 Heading</h3>
                                 <p>Before you head out on a particular day, you’ll need to carefully assess local conditions, and that means running through a list of questions before you set foot in the water. These include:</p>
                                 <p><strong>What’s the water temperature?</strong> How long can you tolerate that temperature? If the water is cold and you haven’t acclimated much yet, keep your swim short and close to shore so you can exit quickly if you get too cold.</p>
                                 <p><strong>How windy is it?</strong> Which direction is the wind coming from? Assessing wind patterns can help you choose a safe direction for your swim, assuming you’re going out and back. For example, it’s nearly always best to swim into the wind first so that you don’t have to fight a headwind when swimming back to your towel on the beach.</p>
                                 <p><strong>What’s the traffic situation?</strong> How busy is the waterway with boaters, anglers, and other users? If you’re struck by a boat, you can be severely injured or killed. It’s unpleasant to swim into a fishing line, and because surfers and kite surfers can cover a lot of area quickly, you don’t want to risk getting in their path. Give all other open water users a wide berth.</p>
                                 <p><strong>What’s the weather?</strong> Is there a chance of lightning in the forecast? Electrical storms pose a danger to open water swimmers, so it’s important to know what the weather is expected to do while you’re out swimming. Storms can and do crop up unexpectedly, but being as forewarned as possible is best.</p>
                                 <p><strong>What’s the water doing?</strong> Where is the tide in its cycle? Are there rip currents present? Is there a sandbar exposed along the route you’re looking to swim? These considerations come into play in marine environments and are critical to understanding whether you can swim your desired route safely.</p>
                                 <p><strong>What about wildlife?</strong> What animals might be in the water that could pose a problem? Are there jellyfish? Sharks? Knowing what to expect in terms of other aquatic creatures can help you determine if it’s a good day for a swim.</p>
                                 <p><strong>What else?</strong> Is there anything else going on locally that might affect your swim? Some swimming areas are closed if there are high bacteria counts, pollution spills, or excessive fertilizer runoff. Having a good look around to assess the environment and the whole picture of the conditions can help you have a safe and fun swim.</p>

                                 <h2>How Is Open Water Swimming Different From Pool Swimming?</h2>
                                 <p>Swimming is swimming, right? Well, not quite. Open water swimming is quite different from pool swimming in several ways.</p>
                                 <p>Although you’re still moving forward under your own power, the lack of walls and the wild environment naturally change everything, including your stroke. Here’s what to consider when comparing pool and open water swimming:</p>
                                 <p><strong>Opaque water.</strong> For many people, the opacity of open water is a major deterrent. After a lifetime of swimming in crystal clear pools, where the bottom is always visible, venturing into the unknown can be frightening and it may take you some time to get used to not being able to see more than a few feet below or ahead of you while you’re swimming.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Currents.</strong> Competition swimming pools, where most Masters workouts take place, are designed to keep water movement to a minimum. Lane lines dampen the wake of swimmers in neighboring lanes, and the depth of the water and the way the walls and gutters are designed help swallow the waves you create while swimming fast. In open water, none of those controls exist, plus you get the bonus of currents and tidal fluctuations that can force you to swim way off the course you’re aiming for.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Waves.</strong> And then there are waves to contend with. Especially when you’re swimming in a coastal area along the shoreline, shore break waves can push you off your path or tumble you back onto the sand. You must stay constantly vigilant for big waves.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Sandbars.</strong> Sandbars can develop in any waterway but are commonly just offshore in coastal areas. They present a challenge to open water swimmers because they change the way water flows around them and can contribute to the development of dangerous rip currents. Also, if the water around the sandbar is very deep, that can become a favorite hangout spot for some species of shark, so beware when navigating waterways with sandbars.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Wildlife.</strong> One of open water swimming’s biggest joys is how it brings you into closer contact with nature, and in some cases, that means more interaction with wild creatures. Whether jellyfish that sting, sharks that could bite, ducks that harbor protozoa that cause itchy rashes, or mosquitos that can transmit disease, each animal brings its own challenges. Know what you’re likely to encounter in whichever waterway you’re visiting.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Water temperature.</strong> Without the benefit of a finely tuned pool heater or chiller, open water swimming spots can be virtually any temperature, from almost freezing to dangerously warm. It’s important to have at least a general understanding of what the temperature is before you start so you can plan a safe swim.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Buoyancy.</strong> Open water just feels different from pool water, and one way that shows up is in how buoyant you are in a particular waterway. In an ocean environment that has a high salt content, you’ll be more buoyant than you would be in a freshwater lake or a pool. This change in buoyancy can alter how efficiently you swim and can make you faster or slow you down. (Here are more things open water swimmers need to know about the differences between fresh and salt water.)</p>
                                 <p><strong>Chafing.</strong> Because of the subtle changes in body position when you’re swimming in open water, depending on the salinity and other conditions, you’ll likely also chafe in different places than you do in a pool. Some folks chafe along the same seams, just more readily in salt water, which can act like sandpaper on your skin. Protect your known chafe points with a product such as TRISWIM’s TRISLIDE or Vaseline before heading out to keep this uncomfortable problem to a minimum.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Gear.</strong> In addition to the location and the swimming itself, the gear you use to swim in open water is often a little different from what you use in the pool. Caps, goggles, and swimsuits still reign supreme, but you should add a tow float for training swims. Ear plugs, nose plug, wetsuit, neoprene booties or gloves, or other heat-retaining gear may also become part of your regular swimming kit when swimming beyond the concrete walls.</p>

                                 <h2>9 Open Water Swimming Tips</h2>
                                 <p>If you know how to swim, you can become an open water swimmer, but it may take a little while to develop some of the specific skills you need to become proficient and comfortable swimming in open water.</p>
                                 <p>Skills you should develop include:</p>
                                 <p><strong>Treading water.</strong> Without any walls in sight, it’s important that you develop the important basic swimming skill of treading water before you take the plunge in open water. Often a key component of beginning swimming lessons, treading water means staying afloat while using a modified breaststroke or “egg beater” kick in an upright position to keep your head and shoulders above the water level. For some beginners, this position can feel strange and tiring, but as you get better at trusting your body to float, you can expend minimal energy and tread water for as long as you need to; it’s a great way to grab a moment’s rest in open water or to take a long look around for the next buoy. If you’re aiming for a longer open water swim that will require taking in foods or liquids, it’s extra critical that you get comfortable with treading water while consuming these items.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Sighting.</strong> In the pool, you don’t have to think much about where you’re going or how to get there—just follow the black line to the wall. In open water, that black line doesn’t exist, and you may not be able to see very far underwater anyway, so you must learn to sight. Perhaps the most common way of sighting is a technique called alligator eyes, in which you lift your head forward just enough to bring your goggles above the waterline every five to 10 strokes. It takes practice to get used to this quick movement and to be able to take in enough of the environment ahead of you to make sense of what you see. You can practice in the pool and open water.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Turning.</strong> Many open water races involve a turnaround point, which is often marked by a bright orange buoy that denotes where competitors should make that turn. You can approximate this experience in the pool by floating a kickboard about halfway down the pool and practicing swimming up to and around it to reverse direction. If you’re aiming to be fast and fancy around a turn buoy, work on learning to flip onto your back to take a couple of backstroke strokes to help you get around the buoy quicker and with less wasted energy. If you’d rather use that opportunity to get a good look at the rest of the course, switch to breaststroke and take a few strokes to help you get the lay of the land—er, water.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Bilateral breathing.</strong> Being able to breathe to both sides can be helpful. For example, if there are wind and waves coming from the side you usually breathe on, breathing on the other side can help you avoid sucking in water. Bilateral breathing is also helpful for keeping you on a straight course and your stroke balanced. Sunlight, other swimmers, and having your kayaker on one side are all good reasons you might want to be able to switch which side you breathe on. Bilateral breathing also might help prevent an overuse injury.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Cold tolerance.</strong> Although it isn’t a skill that every swimmer must build, if you’re planning to swim in locations where the water is cooler than what you’re used to in the pool, you’ll need to determine whether it’s safe for you to do that swim and develop some tolerance for that temperature. The best way to do that is through repeated exposure. A common way to do this is by swimming the temperatures down in the fall, meaning that you continue swimming outside as the weather and water cool. Your swim sessions will naturally shorten as the mercury dips, but your body will get better at handling cold water, and you’ll learn how to keep yourself safe. There’s also gear that will help you adapt to cold water.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Situational awareness.</strong> In open water, you must stay aware of what’s happening around you. It’s easy to sometimes just zone out in the pool and lose count of your laps. In open water you must stay aware of potential hazards, such as boats, wildlife, shifting tides or currents, and changes to weather conditions. This is yet another reason why it’s best to swim with a few other swimmers: More eyes are likely to spot a potential issue before it becomes a problem.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Flexibility.</strong> In open water, getting comfortable with being uncomfortable and staying flexible when challenges arise are important skills you can develop. Learning to accept what you can’t affect while taking steps to overcome the things you can change are key to success in open water and life in general.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Drafting.</strong> If you’re going to be racing in open water, you may also want to learn how to draft off other swimmers, as that can offer a big boost in speed. In drafting, you swim close enough to a slightly faster swimmer so that person’s wake will drag you along. It takes a lot of practice, but research has suggested that drafting effectively could reduce the energy you expend by nearly 40%. That could make the difference between winning a medal and not.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Swim technique.</strong> Last, developing your swim technique so you can swim comfortably for longer periods is an important element for success in open water. Waves and wind can make the water surface more turbulent in open water than you’d find in the confines of the pool, so you may need to have a higher or more flexible recovery than you would in the pool. Open water swimmers also typically don’t kick as much as pool sprinters, and it’s helpful to learn how to adjust your stroke for the conditions you may face in open water. Open water swimmers also have a higher stroke rate than pool swimmers. The pool is a great place to work on that and in time with the right adjustments, you’ll likely find you can cruise along for hours on end.</p>

                                 <h2>Pool Training That Can Help Your Open Water Swimming</h2>
                                 <p>As temperatures fall, many open water swimmers contemplate a return to the pool. Some begrudgingly think about how to transition from a summer of fun swimming out in the open and head back to the pool.</p>
                                 <p>Moving your training back into the pool, however, might just be the best thing you can do to gain an advantage over the competition next season.</p>
                                 <p>A lot of open water swimmers default to going at a long, slow pace when they return to the pool after a summer outdoors. Knowing and practicing your all-day pace is an important skill to train if you’re looking to swim mile after mile across oceans, lakes, or rivers in lengthy events. But you shouldn’t neglect speed work. Even in ultramarathon swims, you still need to have some speed available in case the situation demands it. You might have to fight current, wind, or a turning tide by summoning a sprint at any moment and sustaining that high-output pace for a while. That requires a lot of training.</p>
                                 <p>In shorter open water events, you might be looking to edge out a competitor, but if you haven’t trained your fast-twitch muscles or sprinting capacity, you’ll likely be left behind at the buoy or gasping for air as you near the finish. Neither situation is ideal.</p>
                                 <p>If you embrace interval training in the pool, you can have that extra speed gear ready when you most need it. Instead of dreading a return to the pool, embrace it and focus on the following important areas of training to help you become a better all-around open water swimmer next season.</p>
                                 <h5>Include Interval Training</h5>
                                 <p>Interval training is the holy grail of pool workouts, featuring short bouts of high-intensity swimming that can help you get and stay faster while giving you an incredible cardiovascular and joint-gentle resistance workout.</p>
                                 <p>Interval training is the mainstay of most Masters swimming workouts, and getting in consistent interval training several times a week all winter can help you build strength, stamina, and speed.</p>
                                 <p>Work with a certified Masters coach to help you build a training plan that will help you meet your goals, and get ready to swim faster and more consistently when you get back to open water next spring or summer. USMS members can also access a vast online database of workouts for a variety of goals and fitness levels.</p>
                                 <h5>Practice Pacing</h5>
                                 <p>Although it’s important to get your heart rate up and work your speed intervals, you also need to develop your ability to hold a pace over longer distances. Pool training can help you learn to pace yourself and boost your base pace through steady, consistent work. Over time, you can find your all-day pace, your 5K pace, and your 1-mile race pace and learn how to hold the highest speed possible over the longest distance.</p>
                                 <h5>Learn Bilateral Breathing</h5>
                                 <p>Being able to breathe to both sides can make you a more versatile and comfortable open water swimmer. Depending on the way the wind is blowing, the way the course is laid out, and where competitors might creep up on you during a race, being able to breathe to both sides lets you see all around you and adjust to changing conditions. If you practice breathing to your weaker side in a pool, you can get more comfortable so that when you head back outside, you’ll have made it a habit.</p>
                                 <h5>Get Comfortable With Sighting</h5>
                                 <p>Another key skill in open water is sighting and being able to stay on course. The shortest distance, even in a long-distance event, is a straight line, so staying on course can get you to your end goal faster. Throw some sighting drills into every pool workout to get more comfortable with how to do it most efficiently.</p>
                                 <h5>Drill, Baby, Drill</h5>
                                 <p>Drills are important to improving technique. When you’re swimming in open water all the time, it can be more challenging to keep up with regular drill routines. But in the pool, drills should become part of every workout to reinforce the most efficient technique that will prevent injury and keep you swimming for the long haul. You can also try these five drills the next time you’re in the open water.</p>
                                 <h5>Ground Your Gear</h5>
                                 <p>If you haven’t found the right goggles, cap, or swimsuit yet, trying different options in the pool over the winter will give you plenty of time and opportunity to test out new gear to find what works best for you. Swimming with a snorkel in the pool can also help you prepare for your next open water swim.</p>

                                 <h2>What Equipment Do I Need for Open Water Swimming? And How Do I Care for It?</h2>
                                 <p>Theoretically, swimming should be an inexpensive sport. All you really need is a swimsuit and goggles. Maybe a cap. Maybe ear plugs or a nose plug. And you’re good to go in many a waterway.</p>
                                 <p>However, most swimmers will tell you they’ve spent a small fortune acquiring the tools of the trade over the years, and what works best in one venue doesn’t always work well in another. Case in point, the gear you need for an open water swim may be quite different from what you’d take to the pool for a workout or meet.</p>
                                 <p>Here’s a brief rundown of what should be in your open water gear bag. (And you may want to get a second bag to hold these items separate from your pool training gear for convenience.)</p>
                                 <p><strong>Caps.</strong> You probably have a preferred cap and pair of goggles that are your go-to set for the pool. But in open water, you may find that you’re happier with a silicone cap—which can help retain a little more heat than a latex cap. Certainly a latex cap can work in open water, and ultimately it comes down to what’s most comfortable. If the water is chilly, a silicone or even a neoprene cap can provide a little extra warmth. It’s best to bring a couple so that if one rips, you’ve got a spare at the ready.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Goggles.</strong> You can buy any number of open water–specific goggles these days, and for some swimmers, the added peripheral vision they offer is key to getting to the buoy first or being able to spot an approaching boat before it gets too close. Again, whatever feels most comfortable and keeps the water out of your eyes will do just great. You may also want to invest in a pair of darker-tinted goggles to help block sun glare so you can see more clearly in very sunny conditions. On rainy or overcast days, lighter or clear lenses are usually more practical. Polarized and mirrored goggles also offer benefits.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Sunblock.</strong> If you typically swim in an indoor pool, you probably don’t bring sunblock to the pool. But if you’re in open water, you’ll definitely need protection from the sun. A 2020 study from Southern Cross University in Australia found that surfers and swimmers are six times more likely to develop melanoma, a potentially dangerous form of skin cancer, than other ocean users. Being submerged in water for an hour or more at a stretch makes it difficult to protect your skin because sunblock products are typically only “water resistant” and need to be reapplied every 80 minutes or so. Many marathon swimmers swear by zinc oxide ointment, such as Desitin, which is used primarily to treat diaper rash in babies. It coats the skin in a thick, white cream that stays on well in water. This can prevent sunburn even if you’re in the water for many hours.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Anti-chafing lotion.</strong> Chafing can also be a big issue in many open water venues, particularly in salt water, so be sure to bring Vaseline or another lubricant to load up at chafe points like the shoulders and neck. If you shave any parts of your body, such as a beard or armpits, be prepared for those areas to chafe too, especially the longer you swim; as that 5 o’clock shadow comes in, the pointed ends of many hairs can act like tiny razors against the skin of the shoulder brushing by 20 to 30 times or more per minute.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Earplugs.</strong> Earplugs are super useful for keeping your ears dry, which if you tend to get ear infections easily, is probably a smart move. They can also be helpful when swimming in cold water, as they can help seal out the chill that could disrupt your sense of balance and make you feel colder.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Nose plugs.</strong> It’s not often that you see a pool swimmer rocking the nose plug look, but occasionally it’s a thing. In open water, especially fresh open water where pollen collects and allergies can intensify, a nose plug can be a simple, non-pharmacological measure to keep post-swim sneezes at bay.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Water bottle.</strong> It’s important to stay well hydrated, especially when engaging in physical activity. Always bring a water bottle with you so you can sip water before and after your swim.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Tools and toys.</strong> It’s usually a safe bet to leave the kickboard and hand paddles at the pool. But you might want to bring fins if you’ll be trying to keep up with a faster friend in open water. And if you have any neck issues, a snorkel can be a great adaptive tool for open water swimming.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Tow float.</strong> No one ever uses a tow float in the pool, but in open water, they’re a fantastic safety tool that you should be using on all your training swims. Tow floats make you much more visible to passing boaters and other water users, which can keep them from accidentally running you over. That’s a big plus for sure, and most of them also act as a floating dry bag, so you can stash your keys, wallet, and phone inside thereby prevent a devastating theft if left on the beach.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Towel and changing robe.</strong> When you finish your swim, it’s nice to come back to a fluffy towel or a changing robe that can block the wind and protect your modesty when you’re getting out of your swimsuit and into dry clothes.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Drybag.</strong> Stashing all these items in a drybag can help keep everything dry if it starts to rain while you’re out swimming.</p>

                                 <h2>How to Find the Right Wetsuit for Your Open Water Swimming</h2>
                                 <p>Because wetsuits trap body heat in cold water and provide buoyancy, they have become an integral piece of equipment for many open water swimmers and triathletes. If you’re thinking about wearing a wetsuit for your open water swims, there are some things to know before you buy.</p>
                                 <h5>Fitting</h5>
                                 <p>Finding the wetsuit that fits you best may require some work, but it’s vitally important. A wetsuit that’s too tight will restrict movement and could even make you more likely to develop swimming-induced pulmonary edema, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in your lungs, making it difficult to breathe.</p>
                                 <p>But don’t opt for a baggy wetsuit either: A too-loose wetsuit won’t keep you warm as the water constantly flushes through, and it will act like a parachute, slowing you down by scooping too much water as you swim.</p>
                                 <p>Wetsuit sizing used to be mainly geared for slender triathletes, but more companies are getting the message that athletes come in all shapes and sizes. Many are reflecting this understanding with more sizing options across the spectrum. Still, it’s always best to try on a suit before you buy it to ensure a good fit.</p>
                                 <p>If you don’t live near a retailer that carries wetsuits, consider attending a large triathlon or open water event that has an expo. Chances are good some wetsuit companies will be in attendance with wares to sell. You can also buy online, but check sizing guides, read reviews, and fully read the return policy in case it doesn’t fit.</p>
                                 <p>Wetsuits can be pricey, depending on the specifics, but you can often find good deals on the previous year’s models in the spring and summer. Some manufacturers offer sales in the fall or around the holidays to clear out backstock before new designs arrive for the summer season.</p>
                                 <h5>Donning</h5>
                                 <p>Putting on a wetsuit shouldn’t feel like you’re stuffing yourself into a sausage casing, but neither should it be like slipping into a loose set of pajamas. There’s a skill to putting on a wetsuit. If you’re a novice, ask a veteran for advice so you don’t burn 1,000 calories just getting it on.</p>
                                 <p>The thin neoprene used in wetsuits can also snag and tear, especially if you have long fingernails, so take care to move the suit a little at a time—like you would if pulling up a tight pair of nylon pantyhose—to prevent damaging the material.</p>
                                 <p>Many folks place plastic bags on their hands and feet before stepping into the wetsuit. This reduces friction between the wetsuit and your skin and can make it easier to slide your legs and arms into position. A product such as TRISWIM’s SKIN SLICK can make it easier to get your wetsuit on.</p>
                                 <p>Pulling the suit on fully is the key part of donning the suit and you need to proceed gingerly. If you grab and pull with your thumbs and fingertips when putting on a wetsuit, your fingers may pierce or damage the wetsuit—and that’s bad. Instead, pinch a small amount of material gently between the pad of your thumb and the side of your index finger knuckle when pulling your wetsuit on. Scooch the suit into position a little at a time, starting at your ankles, and slowly inch it up. Visualize the inside of the suit being rolled up your body from your feet.</p>
                                 <h5>Storing</h5>
                                 <p>Heat and time can both take a toll on a wetsuit. Leaving it out in the hot sun can cause melting. Hanging it in a closet for several months can cause stretchy, pointy shoulders. In short, that neoprene might seem tough but it’s actually pretty delicate. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendation and instructions. Typically, you’ll be advised to store your wetsuit flat in a cool, dry place.</p>
                                 <h5>Swimming in a Wetsuit</h5>
                                 <p>Once you’ve found a wetsuit that fits you well, it’s time to hit the water. Here’s what to know before you go.</p>
                                 <h5>Fitting</h5>
                                 <p>Just because your wetsuit felt great when you first put it on doesn’t mean it’ll be your friend after a few hundred meters. Wetsuit fit is a factor in your flexibility and your breathing while you swim. If you’re exerting yourself and breathing heavily, your wetsuit might be constricting. In addition, there may be some spots that just don’t match your body geometry, which can lead to chafing.</p>
                                 <p>And if you’re thinking, “Well, it’s my first swim with it, I just need to break it in,” be forewarned that the fit won’t change much the more you wear it. If you feel like you can’t breathe during that first outing, it’s probably best to return or sell it. There’s a huge secondary market for wetsuits because so many people don’t find the right fit the first time and didn’t check the return policy before they bought.</p>
                                 <p>Chafing—especially at the back of the neck—is common with wetsuits, even ones that fit properly. Products like TRISWIM’s TRISLIDE can help minimize the worst of the chafing. Just be sure to choose a product that does not contain petroleum jelly, as this ingredient can break down the neoprene and ruin your wetsuit.</p>
                                 <h5>Swimming</h5>
                                 <p>Water and weather conditions will be a factor in which wetsuit to choose. How cold it’ll be can determine whether you should have a full-sleeve or sleeveless or full-length or knee-length or shorter suit. Most of these factors are personal considerations and, of course, subject to race rules.</p>
                                 <p>Know yourself. If you’re used to having a close feel for the water on your inner forearms for your freestyle catch, you might need to wear a sleeveless wetsuit. If you don’t like cold water, a thicker suit will provide extra warmth. A thicker suit will also provide more buoyancy, which inexperienced swimmers often like. Experienced swimmers tend to dislike the extra buoyancy if they already have a good body position. Many wetsuit manufacturers now make suits with thicker and thinner panels on a single suit to accommodate technique, experience, and preference.</p>
                                 <h5>Doffing</h5>
                                 <p>Removing a wetsuit after a swim is an event unto itself. In an open water race, it doesn’t matter how long it takes for you to get out of your wetsuit. But in a triathlon, how long you spend in T1 peeling off your wetsuit is counted against your overall time. Some large triathlons have peelers—people whose sole job is to help you get out of your wetsuit—because when you’re cold and wet it can be hard to remove.</p>
                                 <p>Still, removing your wetsuit, even with help from a peeler, is a skill you need to practice. Have a friend work with you. If you’re more leisurely about it, it’s easier to protect the integrity of your wetsuit. Avoid violent and jarring motions. Regardless of how you doff your suit, don’t be in such a rush that you damage it.</p>

                                 <h2>Where Can I Find Open Water Swim Locations Near Me?</h2>
                                 <p>Now that you’ve got the right gear, let’s go swimming. But wait! Where are you headed?</p>
                                 <p>There are lots of places to swim, but swimming alone is dangerous and not advisable, so you should gather some swimming buddies to go with you or connect with a group that's already formed. There are resources out there to help you achieve this.</p>
                                 <p>Start with your local Masters club. A simple email to the coach may well result in a connection with a local group of open water enthusiasts.</p>
                                 <p>You can also use social networking tools. Facebook is home to many local and regional open water swimming groups and can be a good place to look for like-minded friends to swim with, especially when you travel. Post what you're looking for and you might be surprised about who sees it and responds.</p>
                                 <p>Open water–specific sites, such as the Marathon Swimmers Forum, offer connections with local open water swimmers. That site also includes a rich archive of advice, best practices, and sometimes funny stories from a host of experienced marathon swimmers the world over. Even if you're not planning to do a marathon swim, there's still lots of great info and many open water swimmers to connect with on the forum.</p>
                                 <p>Once you have a group together, you need to select a place to swim. Swimmers not living in coastal regions will be relegated to lakes, ponds, and rivers. Check with local authorities about the cleanliness of the water and any swimming restrictions that may be in place before you go marching in. A lot of things can go into determining whether a waterway is safe for swimming.</p>
                                 <p>Once you've selected a clean, healthy, and safe body of water, use the buddy system. Don't ever swim alone! If the body of water you're enjoying is large or home to lots of boats and traffic, you should also ask a kayaker to shadow you. A kayak's slightly higher vantage point means it's more visible to approaching boaters and kayakers can also spot dangers farther off than you can at water level. The added protection of a lifeguard on shore is a safety bonus worth seeking out.</p>

                                 <h2>How to Handle Common Open Water Swimming Dangers</h2>
                                 <p>In ancient times, mariners dreaded venturing too far from the shoreline for fear of the lurking monsters at the edge of the then-known universe. Although the beasties and creatures they imagined have been largely proven mythical, there are still some hazards in the open water—even close to shore—that can ruin a nice swim.</p>
                                 <p>If you're swimming in the ocean, there's a whole range of hazards related to water conditions that you need to be aware of before you get started. Here's a quick overview of the most common conditions (and critters) that pose a threat to ocean swimmers:</p>
                                 <p><strong>Rip currents.</strong> Rip currents are columns of water movement that begin at the shoreline and extend perpendicular to the beach for anywhere from a few yards to a quarter of a mile or more. They can suck a swimmer out well past the intended swimming place and can be difficult to get out of. Rips result from bumpy silt and sand at the bottom and the surging surf rolling across that uneven terrain. If you're trapped in a rip, go with it until you feel it weaken. Then swim parallel to shore until you are completely free of its tug—you'll know it when you feel it. Then you can turn and swim directly into shore, well away from the rip. The swimmer will always lose in a head-on fight against a rip current, so it is better to ride it out before trying to return to shore.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Tidal changes.</strong> In 2004, 19 Chinese migrant clam diggers died when a rushing, incoming springtide closed in around them in Morecambe Bay, England. Caught unawares and unable to outrun the quickly rising surf, most of the workers in the group drowned while rescue teams attempted to save those who were able to cling to what little higher ground they could find in the tidal flats. Most places in the U.S. do not have such a quick and dramatic turn of tide, but impending storms, seasonal fluctuations, and moon phases can all affect the timing, speed, and height of tide cycles. To avoid potential disaster, get to know the area before you head into the water. Local anglers are usually the best source of this kind of information, so head to the docks and ask around.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Currents.</strong> Similar to tidal changes, currents are a uniquely local phenomenon, and anglers and boaters familiar with the waters you'll be venturing into can be your best source of information regarding timing your swims. Knowing which way the current is running can make or break your swim, as swimming directly into a strong current is often nearly impossible, if not exhausting and slow-going. Understanding local currents and timing is critical to planning an effective training swim or event, so learn the water and how it moves before you start.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Surf and chop.</strong> General water conditions on any given day can change dramatically from minute to minute and pose a risk to your swim. Along the shoreline is one danger zone you need to learn about. Especially at high tide, a sharp drop-off from the beach at the high-water mark can result in a difficult shore break that can make entering and exiting the water treacherous. Farther out, wind, sandbars, and uneven bottom conditions can stir up chop, which can make you feel like you're trying to hold a straight line inside a washing machine. Training in rough water can be great experience if you plan on tackling an event with a lot of participants, but for many casual swimmers it isn't fun to get tossed around in such conditions. Prepare for the unexpected and be ready for anything the ocean may throw at you.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Water temperature.</strong> Like Goldilocks, open water swimmers need the water to be in that sweet, “just right” range, which for most adults falls somewhere between 65 and 80 degrees. Go much warmer, and you risk heat stroke, hyperthermia, and dangerous complications from overexertion. Go much colder, and you risk hypothermia, a potentially lethal condition that can sneak up quickly. Find out what your most comfortable temperature is, and if the water is far away from that point, enter with caution. If the water is cold, a wetsuit will help. If the water is very warm, skipping the swim altogether might be the safest option.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Boat traffic.</strong> Many waterways where you'll want to swim are also inhabited by boaters, who may or may not be interested in sharing the water. Boat traffic is a major hazard and just one of the many reasons you should never swim alone. Keep your eyes and ears open for approaching boats at all times and wear a bright cap (but not white) and a tow float.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Pollution.</strong> Industrial America grew up on rivers and harbors and not all the 19th century gunk that progress left behind has been cleaned up yet, despite the sweeping changes established by the Clean Water Act of 1972. Make sure you know whether it's safe—from a pollution standpoint—to enter a body of water before you swim. Who knows whether those rusting shopping carts you can see on days when the water clarity is high pose a health risk or if that high clarity is a sign of a problem itself.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Sun.</strong> The best way to deal with sun exposure is sunblock, so make sure you invest in a good one. Open water swimmers must also take care to select sunblock brands that are highly water resistant to prevent them washing off straightaway. Many people also don't use enough sunblock. You should be using at least a full ounce every time you apply and make sure to hit areas that might not be fully exposed to the sun, as reflections off the water can mean a bad sunburn in areas you might not expect.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Wind.</strong> Wind, which can create choppy water conditions and wind chill, can be a bad thing for an open water swimmer. General rule: If a small craft advisory is in effect in your waterway, skip the open water session and head to the pool instead.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Hypothermia.</strong> Hypothermia is one of the biggest challenges swimmers face in open water. Knowing the signs, symptoms, and solutions is important. Signs can include a drop in stroke rate (the number of strokes a swimmer takes in a minute). Shivering, slurred speech, an inability to follow directions, or giving incongruous answers to simple questions are also symptoms of hypothermia. A swimmer suffering hypothermia should be removed from the water immediately. Remove the swimmer's wet swimsuit and any other wet clothing and wrap the person in dry towels and blankets. The swimmer should sip warm fluids as they can to help them rewarm from the inside. In all cases, rewarming should be done slowly and cautiously so as not to shock the body. If the swimmer is unconscious or does not improve once removed from the water, seek immediate medical attention.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Other health risks.</strong> Heart attacks. Water aspiration. Strokes. Swimming Induced Pulmonary Edema. All of these can happen at any time in the open water, and making sure you are healthy and able to engage in vigorous exercise before you head out to the water is your best bet for reducing the chances that one of these major problems will ruin your swim. Swimming with others is also vitally important: If you suddenly suffer a heart attack and go under, having a swim partner with you means your chances of survival rise from nil if you’re alone to a fighting chance.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Nasty nibblers.</strong> In the ocean, you’re likely to face jellyfish, sea lice, and various other stinging creatures that cause pain, rashes, or itchiness. In fresh water, mosquitoes, leeches, and lampreys all sometimes help themselves to a tasty blood snack. In North America, mosquitoes can carry diseases and illness, and some cause malaria, dengue fever, or any of the other marquee mosquito-borne illnesses the World Health Organization warns against. West Nile and Eastern equine encephalitis (Triple E) are a risk in North America. Find out if these or other insect-borne diseases are present in your area and use a mosquito repellent to lessen the chances that you will be bitten. Leeches and lampreys don’t typically carry infectious diseases, so you’ll be left to deal with the ick factor more than any lasting illness if you tangle with one of these animals. Deer ticks, those tiny carriers of Lyme disease, can also be present in the wooded approaches to many North American lakes and ponds, so be sure to do a tick check after each swim.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Swimmer’s itch.</strong> If those other nasty nibblers weren’t enough, some swimmers also report experiencing an unpleasant sensation called swimmer’s itch after swimming in some lakes and ponds. Caused by a tiny protozoa found in fresh water, swimmer’s itch is a rash that can appear all over a swimmer’s body within a few hours of swimming in an infected lake. It’s unpleasant for sure, but simply rinsing off in clean water immediately after a swim will reduce symptoms greatly. Stagnant or small lakes or ponds are also more prone to harbor these animals, so seek out bigger waterways with a healthy exchange of water. Water that moves flushes out the bugs.</p>
                                 <p>Though this list of possible hazards is long and might seem intimidating, don’t let it frighten you. A little smart planning will mitigate many of these potential problems before they start, and the rewards are well worth the risks.</p>

                                 <h2>What Open Water Swimmers Need to Understand About Sea Life</h2>
                                 <p>When you enter open water, you’re entering a different domain, one where you’re not necessarily at the top of a food chain. In open water, humans and our lack of gills and woeful lack of speed relative to other animals of similar size means we’re at a disadvantage if we encounter another animal that could cause harm.</p>
                                 <p>Depending on where you’re swimming, you may encounter any of the following other inhabitants of Planet Earth during a swim, and knowing how to respond when you’re sharing an environment with these beings can help you stay safe.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Jellyfish.</strong> The number one hazard for open water swimmers venturing into most marine environments is jellyfish. These globs of organic matter lack a brain, but many of the 1,600 identified species sport oodles of nasty stinging cells that can pack a wallop. Some jellyfish stings can be deadly, so make sure you know which species is endemic in any waterway you’ll be entering and know how to manage a sting for the species you’re most likely to encounter. If you do get stung, rinsing the area with salt water and then using ice to cool it down is best in most cases. (For more information, here’s an in-depth guide to treating jellyfish stings.) If you develop any allergy-like symptoms, an over-the-counter antihistamine can help soothe those. Although these remedies work for a lot of jellies, for potentially deadly box or Irukandji jellyfish stings, seek emergency medical care.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Sharks.</strong> Ah, sharks. They’re the first thing nonswimmers ask about when they find out you’re an open water swimmer, and our cultural obsession with these splendid creatures far exceeds their real threat; you’re more likely to die from an encounter with an angry cow than you are from a shark bite. Still, in some coastal areas, shark sightings and encounters have increased in recent years as seal and sea lion populations have rebounded, thanks to environmental and fishing regulations. Apps such as Sharktivity can help you stay current with local shark sightings.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Seals or sea lions.</strong> Seals and sea lions are not only some sharks’ favorite foods, but they can also be a threat in their own right, as they can be territorial and may bite swimmers who get too close to their designated spot. Sea lions and seals tend to congregate in certain areas in large groups. If you see a pod of them amassed on a beach, move down the coast until you find a place that isn’t frequented by these handsome pinnipeds.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Mosquitos and other winged, biting things.</strong> In and around the water, you’ll sometimes encounter things that fly and bite, namely mosquitos, gnats, and greenhead flies. They’re no fun, and mosquitoes are the deadliest animal to humans because they can transmit malaria, dengue fever, and other diseases. Use bug repellent and avoid dawn and dusk, when these critters tend to be more active.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Seaweed and kelp.</strong> Sea life includes flora as well as fauna, and in many marine environments you’re liable to encounter seaweed or kelp. Although these aquatic plants are usually harmless to humans, other creatures may inhabit clumps of seaweed and kelp, so just be wary when venturing through and around them.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Milfoil and other freshwater weeds.</strong> Many bodies of fresh water have their version of seaweed, which can be long weeds such as milfoil. Again, although such plant life isn’t typically harmful to humans, it can be distressing when you swim smack into a pack of it, and fish, turtles, or other creature may be living there. Be aware of your surroundings.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Algae and cyanobacteria.</strong> Certain types of algae and cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae, can be dangerous to humans and your pets. There are several species of cyanobacteria, and not all produce toxins, but those that do can cause illness if ingested. Check with your local environmental authority to find out if they’re testing the water and if a potentially dangerous algal bloom has been detected. In such instances, it’s best to skip your swim until the algae or cyanobacteria counts return to a safer level. Avoiding waterways with limited water flow is also a safe bet, as the more water that flushes through an area (particularly freshwater spots), the more likely it is to push out those toxins and dilute the harm they can cause.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Other critters.</strong> In addition to algae or cyanobacteria, you may also encounter other bacteria, viruses, parasites, and protozoa that can cause health problems or just put a real damper on your swim.</p>
                                 <p>To keep yourself safe in all cases, check local regulations, keep tabs on water quality tests, and pay attention to any “No Swimming” signs you might find along the shore—they’re usually put up for a good reason. If after any swim you develop symptoms such as diarrhea, skin rashes, ear or eye pain, cough, or congestion, ask your health care provider for advice.</p>

                                 <h2>How to Manage Feelings of Anxiety and Panic in Open Water Swimming</h2>
                                 <p>Although open water swimming can be calming, cathartic, and tranquil, not everyone feels comfortable in the open water. Even experienced pool swimmers sometimes panic while swimming in open water. Not being able to see the bottom and the feeling of being far from the safety of land can contribute to the anxiety some swimmers feel when out in the open.</p>
                                 <p>Rest assured that this is a normal response to a perceived danger, and many of the world’s top open water swimmers have also experienced sensations of fear in open water. The key is to keep the panic from getting the better of you. Easier said than done, perhaps, but regular exposure to open water—particularly when done safely in a group—should help. Over time, you’ll become accustomed to the quirks of open water and overcome your fear.</p>
                                 <h5>So what do you do if you start to feel panicked during a swim?</h5>
                                 <p>Roll on your back. Sometimes just flipping on your back and floating for a moment, breathing as much as you want, can help you overcome the beginnings of a panic attack. One of the first symptoms of a panic attack is hyperventilation, so allowing yourself access to unrestricted breathing may help curb your symptoms. Watch the clouds flitting by overhead or just shut your eyes and focus on relaxing. This may be enough to get your head back into the now so you can continue swimming along.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Call for help.</strong> If you’re swimming with a group, even just having a buddy come alongside to swim with you may make a big difference. Ask that person to stay with you as you head back to shore. If you have a kayaker shadowing you, even better. Wave your kayaker over and hang onto their boat for a moment. See if you can calm yourself down and catch your breath. Just having a quick chat with someone may help bring you back from the brink. Once you’re feeling calmer, you can resume swimming.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Head to shore.</strong> It’s OK to say you’re scared and get out. Especially if this is your first time in open water, getting out before you get into trouble is infinitely wise. Just remember, the best way to beat a fear is to face it head-on. If you have a difficult outing, don’t be scared to try again. Stay close to shore where you can stand up if you need to, and just keep trying. Eventually, you can get used to it.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Talk to someone.</strong> If your panic attacks are particularly scary, you might want to talk to a mental health professional. There could be an underlying issue contributing to the way you’re feeling, and exploring those concerns may help you learn to enjoy open water more with the added benefit of releasing whatever root problem might be at work.</p>
                                 <p>If it’s not for you, head back to the pool. It’s OK to say, “I tried it and it’s just not for me.” There’s no shame in deciding that you just prefer pool swimming.</p>

                                 <h2>How to Pick the Right Open Water Swimming Event</h2>
                                 <p>If you’re new to open water swimming and want to train for an event, starting smaller will likely result in a more successful outcome. There are lots of events out there in the 1- to 2-mile range that would make a great target for your first open water race. In addition, local triathlons can also be a good place for budding open water swimmers to start.</p>
                                 <p>USMS offers open water national championships that range from 1 mile to 9. Other standard distances include:</p>
                                 <p>750 meters: the swim portion of a sprint triathlon<br>
                                 1.5 kilometers: the swim portion of an Olympic-distance triathlon<br>
                                 1 mile<br>
                                 1.2 miles: the swim portion of a half IRONMAN<br>
                                 2 miles: USMS Cable Swim National Championship event distance<br>
                                 2.4 miles: the swim portion of an IRONMAN<br>
                                 3.1 miles: 5K open water swim<br>
                                 6.2 miles: 10 kilometers—the threshold for marathon swimming. Any swim of 10K or longer is considered a marathon swim</p>
                                 <p>There are a host of other nonstandard distances and races to be found in every corner of the U.S. as well. That’s part of the beauty of open water racing: The course and the conditions on the day determine how long you’ll be out there and it’s always a race against who shows up on the day, the elements, and yourself. Every day is different, and you never get the same swim twice in open water.</p>
                                 <h5>Safety First</h5>
                                 <p>When selecting an event, look for one with a strong track record of safety. Read reviews of the event online or ask other competitors who took part in previous years how they felt about the safety of the event.</p>
                                 <p>Some swimmers also advocate the “new restaurant” approach to events: Just as some food critics recommend skipping a new restaurant in the first week it opens until the fridges are fully stocked and the bugs worked out among the waitstaff and order system, so too should you be wary about taking part in a new event’s first year. Among good race directors, safety plans evolve each year based on participant feedback from the previous year, so sometimes waiting until the second iteration of an event can be a smart and safety-conscious idea.</p>
                                 <h5>The Next Event</h5>
                                 <p>If you’ve gotten comfortable at the 1-mile swim level, maybe it’s time to start thinking about a stretch goal. Try a 2-mile event or even a 5K. The criteria for selecting a stretch goal should be the same: Find a safe event that you have enough time to train for. And then build a training plan, stay motivated, and have fun.</p>
                                 <p>Going for the stretch and succeeding after doing your homework is one of the most satisfying aspects of open water swimming.</p>

                                 <h2>How to Train for Your Open Water Swim</h2>
                                 <p>Training for an open water race or event works best when you set goals and train consistently. Although swimming as much as possible in open water makes sense, many swimmers also use the pool extensively for training to build or maintain speed, try new nutritional products, and get comfortable with the concept of eating and drinking while treading water.</p>
                                 <h5>What’s Your Goal?</h5>
                                 <p>Building a training program for an open water swim depends on one thing primarily: what you want to achieve. If it’s a 1-mile ocean race, then your training plan should include a focus on sighting, learning how to turn at a buoy, and getting used to transitioning quickly from prone in the water to running up on shore to the finish line. All these things take practice, and you can conduct drills both in open water and the pool to help you prepare.</p>
                                 <p>If, however, you’re aiming to complete a long distance solo swim such as a Catalina Channel crossing, you don’t need to practice sighing or buoy turns; rather, you need to nail down your nutrition for the eight to 15 hours it will take and learn to cope with the psychological challenges such a long swim can present. This kind of training will also likely take place in the pool and open water. It’s smart to mix up your training and surroundings to help you stay motivated, especially if you’re training for a long race.</p>
                                 <p>These two ends of the distance spectrum will also require different amounts of training. For a 1-mile ocean swim, doing a typical Masters workout three times a week is probably sufficient. For a channel swim, logging 60 miles or more a month isn’t uncommon. Getting in this kind of yardage will require dedication and a strong desire to meet challenges as they arise, whether they be shoulder injuries from overuse, the boredom that can settle in during an especially long training session, or juggling the demands of work and family life with your training time.</p>
                                 <h5>Want a Coach?</h5>
                                 <p>Finding a coach who has experience with open water swimming can help, but it’s not a requirement. If you do your homework and connect with other open water swimmers, you can build your own program. Still, having the external motivation of a coach can help on those days when you just don’t feel like jumping into an icy lake at dawn.</p>
                                 <p>Similarly, you’ll find you come to rely on your training buddies to get through the drudgery of lots of training. One of the best ways to train is to gather a group of swimmers who are all training for the same event and support each other. That way, you can keep each other motivated and share what you learn as you go.</p>
                                 <p>This approach can also provide variability in your training plans. For example, have each member of the group draft the workout for a day of the week to keep yourself from falling into the same old workout rut each time.</p>
                                 <p>A smart training plan for open water will usually include a ramp-up phase that merges into a high-volume phase. As your body adapts, you can add yet more distance until you hit the taper period shortly before your big event. In this way, training for an open water event follows the same general pattern as any other swim training program you’re likely to experience in the pool.</p>
                                 <p>Typically, most swimmers will peak out distance-wise anywhere from six weeks to 10 days before the big day, and then spend the rest of the time doing maintenance swims, resting, hydrating, and eating well during their taper.</p>
                                 <p>A general rule for most endurance events is that you’ll stand a good chance of being able to finish in a single race whatever mileage you can comfortably complete in a week on a consistent basis. In other words, if you’re aiming for a 12-mile swim, you can feel pretty sure of your success if you’ve logged at least a few weeks of 12 or more miles per week in training.</p>
                                 <p>How you divide up that mileage is mostly down to the time you can spend and your preferences. For longer swim events, many swimmers aim to complete at least one long swim a week (usually on a weekend day) with several other shorter sessions on weekdays.</p>
                                 <p>For some swimmers, the longest swim they’ll complete prior to a marathon event is about three-quarters of the total distance (or total expected time) they intend to swim during the event. If using this approach, a 15-mile training swim would probably be the longest training session they complete in preparation for a 20-mile event. Or a six-hour training swim may be enough for an event expected to take eight hours or so.</p>
                                 <h5>Find Your Own Path</h5>
                                 <p>That said, all of these suggestions are just that: suggestions. Ultimately, you’ll need to develop your own program and find what works for you. Each swimmer’s physiology, goals, and psychological approach are unique. What works for one person might not be the optimal choice for you.</p>
                                 <p>Still, using other swimmers’ experiences as a jumping-off point to build a program is generally a good idea, so ask around and find a swimmer who has completed your goal swim. Ask how they prepared and if that plan worked well.</p>
